 * Transmit start condition

 * by another master only after a STOP condition is detected.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *      mode    The request control state of the master (transmit or receive).
 *              State of mode will control the R/W bit value.
 *
 * Returns:
 *     Transmission status code.

 * 0 (SDA active low) then the master will write to the slave device. If the
 * R/W bit is 1 (SDA passive high) then the master will read from slave device.
 * The address/direction byte is acknowledged by the slave as the 9th bit.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *     address    7-bit address of slave

 * If the slave device does not acknowledges transfer this  means that there is
 * no more data or the device is not ready for the transfer yet.

 * additional data to the master until NACK is transmitted.
